# Operating System (OS)

### Definition

An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the application with the help of operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).

### Why OS is needed?

- **Hardware Interaction:** Operating systems facilitate communication between hardware components and software applications.
- **Resource Management:** They manage system resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and peripherals efficiently.
- **User Interface:** Provide a graphical or command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
- **File Management:** Organize and manage files and directories on storage devices.
- **Security:** Implement security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and malicious software.
- **Process Management:** Handle the execution of multiple processes or tasks simultaneously.
- **Device Drivers:** Provide drivers to enable the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.
- **Memory Management:** Allocate and deallocate memory for processes to ensure efficient usage of system memory.
- **Networking:** Enable communication between computers and devices over a network.
- **Updates and Maintenance:** Facilitate updates, patches, and maintenance to keep the system secure and up-to-date.
