# Virtual machines

### Definition

A virtual machine (VM) is a self-contained computing environment with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, all created from a shared pool of hardware resources. A hypervisor is the software that manages this isolation and the creation and management of VMs.

The physical machine running these VMs is known as the host machine, host computer, host operating system, or simply the host. The multiple VMs that utilize its resources are referred to as guest machines, guest computers, guest operating systems, or simply guests. The hypervisor manages compute resources such as CPU, memory, and storage as a collective pool that can be dynamically allocated between existing guests or assigned to new virtual machines.
